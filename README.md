**Trivia Gamep** is an app that allows players to play trivia questions.

Time spent: **14** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] App launches to an Options screen where user can modify the types of questions presented when the game starts. Users should be able to choose:
  - [x] Number of questions
  - [x] Category of questions
  - [x] Difficulty of questions
  - [x] Type of questions (Multiple Choice or True False)
- [x] User can tap a button to start trivia game, this presents questions and answers in a List or Card view.
  - Hint: For Card view visit your FlashCard app. List view is an equivalent to UITableView in UIKit. Much easier to use!

- [x] User can submit choices and is presented with a score on trivia game
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

    - I have made the app exceptionally UI visual appealing.
